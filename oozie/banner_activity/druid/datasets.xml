Defines reusable datasets for druid loaded data.
Thoses datasets provide ways to synchronise oozie jobs
but doesn't link to folders with real data. The folders only
contain _SUCCESS file to corrdinate jobs.
Use this datasets in your coordinator.xml files by setting:

    ${start_time}     - the initial instance of your data.
                        Example: 2014-04-01T00:00Z
    ${druid_banner_directory} - Path to directory where _SUCCESS file is time bucketed.
                        Example: /wmf/data/wmf/banner_activity

    <!--
    To unpad MONTH, DAY, and HOUR, we force coercion to a number by
    adding 0.

    Note that we do not use “${...}” but “${"$"}{...}", as dataset files are
    passed to EL twice in cascade, and in the first EL level, ${MONTH}
    evaluates to the string “${MONTH}”. Hence, we escape the dollar sign in
    “${....}" to “${"$"}{...}”. At the first EL level, “${"$"}” gets turned
    into a dollar sign, and “{...}”  is just passed along. Hence, we arrive
    at “${...}” as input for the second EL level. There, the variables hold
    their expected values, and we can start unpadding them.
